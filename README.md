## 🎙 How to propose a talk

> ## Title of your talk
>
> **Talk description**
>
> Tell us what you'd like to talk about
>
> **Presenter(s)**
>
> Include GitHub handles where possible. Add your Twitter handle if you wish
>
> **Presenter's bio**
>
> A short introduction of yourself
>
> **Duration requested**
>
> 10min, 20min, 30min
>
> **Deck URL (if any)**
>
> You can add this part in later

## 📢 Open announcements

Have something you'd like to tell the audience? We have an open announcement segment for you to announce job opportunities, promote a meet up, upcoming conferences, etc. Please comment on the month's [issue](https://github.com/ReactJSSG/meetups/issues) to give the organizers a heads-up.

## 📝 Notes to speakers

- Be punctual for the event; talks start at 7.30pm - _your talk may be rescheduled if you are late_
- Bring your own equipment - _laptops, video adapters, power adapters, presenter clickers, etc._
- Request for wifi access from the host
- RSVP on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/React-Singapore/) for the event - _this is for building security clearance_

## 💬 Reach out to the organizers

The most effective way is to open an [issue](https://github.com/ReactJSSG/meetups/issues/new) if you have questions, suggestions, or feedback.
